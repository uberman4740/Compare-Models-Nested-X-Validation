# Compare-Models-Nested-X-Validation
A Python framework for comparing machine learning models with nested cross validation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves.  As an example, support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression models are used to classify flower species of the Iris dataset, and the models are compared through nested cross validation and ROC curve analysis.
